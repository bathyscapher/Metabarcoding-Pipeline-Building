# Pipeline Building OTU
Generally following the [MiSeq SOP](https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/), the major steps are:
1. Read merging/contigs assembly
1. Alignment to reference database (SILVA)
1. Pre-clustering
1. Chimera detection
1. Singleton filtering
1. Distance matrix
1. OTU clustering and classification
